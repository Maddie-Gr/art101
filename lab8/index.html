				<h1> Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
				<p> The idea of this lab was to work with a partner to experiment with anon functions and callbacks. </p>

				<h2> Challenges </h2>
				<p> I didn't have many challenges with this lab except I used a double variable once and that confused
					me for a second. Other than that I forgot to add my CSS file for a bit so that was a lot of
					time wasted on a pretty simple fix. I decided to do two functions, isOdd and isEven, because I had some extra time.
				</p>


				<h2> Results </h2>
				<p> Make your way to the console to see the output!</p>
