		<h1>Lab 16: JSON and APIs (XKCD comic!)</h1>
		<p> The idea of this lab was to work with a partner to experiment with processing JSON from an API.  </p>





		<h2> Challenges </h2>
		<p> After the last lab, this one wasn't much of a challenge other than setting up the API again which was done with only
			minor difficulties.
