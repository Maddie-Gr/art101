	<h1> Lab 3 - File Structures </h1>
	<p> The idea of this lab was to understand and write psuedocode to get in the habit of thinking in terms of psuedocoding before launching into a coding project. </p>

	<h2> Challenges </h2>
	<p> I didn't really have any challenges with this lab. Understanding psuedocode was easy enough, as I have past
		experience with it from when I took my Python classes. So writing out psuedocode was not very difficult and
		I completed the lab without complications.
	</p>

	<h2> Results </h2>
	<p> The resulting psuedocode from the lab can be found below: </p>
