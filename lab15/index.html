		<h1> Lab 15 - AJAX</h1>
		<p> The idea of this lab was to work with a partner to experiment with jQuery and AJAX.  </p>





		<h2> Challenges </h2>
		<p>
			After attempting some other APIs my partner found this one and we thought it would be
			easier to work with, which it was. We weren't sure how to find information besides the url but
			managed to work around it.
