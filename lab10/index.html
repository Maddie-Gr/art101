			<h1> Lab 10 - JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>
			<p> The idea of this lab was to work with a partner to explore JavaScript events.  </p>

			<h2> Challenges </h2>
			<p> I'm not sure if it was just me, but I had trouble deciphering the instructions on what to
			and what exactly was expected from the lab. I was unable to get the script output to show for a while,
			and afterwards didn't really understand what to do next. This lab was challenging for me and I had to get
			a good amount of help from my partner.
			</p>


			<h2> Results </h2>
			<p> Here is the script output </p>
