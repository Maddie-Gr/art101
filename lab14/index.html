		<h1> Lab 13 - Loops</h1>
		<p> The idea of this lab was to work with a partner to experiment with loops.  </p>





		<h2> Challenges </h2>
		<p> This lab was rather easy because I don't really have any problems that need debugging in past labs.
		</p>



		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> N/A I did not need to do any debugging for past labs.
