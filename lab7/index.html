				so that I felt confident enough to try and add some extra things on the page. My biggest issue was,
				once again, formatting the image on the page. I guess I'm just bad at that. It also took me a hot second
				to make sure this text block in particular didn't get hidden under the very trustworthy Emperor Palpatine.
