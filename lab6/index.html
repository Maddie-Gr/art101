		<h1> Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
		<p> The idea of this lab was to experiment with arrays and objects in JavaScript. </p>

		<h2> Challenges </h2>
		<p> Once again, I had trouble with getting the JavaScript to show up on the page under results but after some troubleshooting
			with my partner I was able to get it to work. I also had some difficlty formatting the image <thead>
				way I wanted on the page.
